# BlackJack

Simply trying to make a basic version of blackjack card game where you can play against the computer

My knowledge of blackjack is somewhat limited, so expect the computer to do some 900IQ plays

### TODO

- Make Standing permanent
- ~~Figure out the winner if both players stand on number below 21~~
- Smarter computer opponent
- ~~Add a win counter~~
- Save current wins (persistece)
- Make Ace value be both 11 and 1 (currently only 1)
- Expand with functions like Split and Double

- Handle unlikely scenarios (currently it can only display 5 cards,
  so if you get 4 Aces and a 2, your score is 6, and you will most
  likely want to Hit again, however it cant display the 6th card)
